# Voidy Translations

> **Translations are currently not part of the first release, expect translations to be added very soon! Any contributions beforehand are very appreciated.**

###### **Voidy** is the community core solution for Voidyxia, an always evolving community. Voidy allows users to verify and use the verified data to handle any kind of sub infrastructure that relate to Voidyxia's projects.

Voidy responds to users ephemerally in most cases, thus allowing us to create language settings for users to choose from. If you're interested in translating Voidy to a specific language, please visit [the Contribution guidelines](docs/contributing.md) for this repository.
